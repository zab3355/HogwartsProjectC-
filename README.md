# Hogwarts Project - IGME 201
Created a profile interface for users to load, save, and clear data using C#. Has the ability to store data into each profile and return them to the user. The user is able to modify that data in various ways. Since the theme of the project was Harry Potter, I used various Harry Potter like fonts throughout my menus.
